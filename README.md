# FootballDataLab

My Personal Research Lab for Data Science in Football.

## Description

Passionate about Data Science and Football, I am interested in exploring and contributing as much as possible at the crossroads of these two exciting disciplines. This repository will keep a record of learning, research, and other projects related to Data Science for football. Here will be provided some reviews on various libraries and tools specific to football data science, along with summaries and criticisms of readings related to football culture and analysis. This will also be accompanied by personal projects in which the previously mentioned libraries and tools are used to analyze match data, player performances, team tactics, and every other relevant thing around football. This project is an attempt to understand in-depth the impact of Data Science on football, sharing the findings and creations that come out of it with the community, in their inspiration and information.
